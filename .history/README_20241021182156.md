# Movie Explorer

**Movie Explorer** is a React-based web application that allows users to browse, search, and explore movies and TV shows. The app integrates with **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** to fetch real-time data, providing details such as movie descriptions, release dates, and ratings. The app includes a watchlist feature, search functionality, and a responsive UI with dark/light mode support.

## Features

- **Browse Movies**: Displays popular and trending movies fetched from TMDb.
- **Movie Search**: Search for movies by title using a functional search bar.
- **Movie Details**: View in-depth details about selected movies such as synopsis, release date, cast, and more.
- **Watchlist**: Add movies to a watchlist for future reference.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes for an improved viewing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Client-side Routing**: Efficient navigation between pages using React Router.
- **Persistent Data**: Watchlist persists across sessions using local storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (with React Router, React Query)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, Global CSS Variables
- **State Management**: React Context for theme management
- **API**: The Movie Database (TMDb)
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for watchlist persistence

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+)
- npm or yarn (for package management)
- [TMDb API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) (required for movie data)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-explorer.git
   cd movie-explorer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your TMDb API key:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Dark/Light Mode

The dark and light mode themes are globally applied across the entire app. The theme context is managed via React's Context API, and CSS variables are used to define colors for both modes.

To toggle between dark and light modes, click the **"Switch to Dark Mode"** or **"Switch to Light Mode"** button located in the navigation bar. The mode selection will persist as you navigate through different pages.

```

## Watchlist Feature

- Users can add or remove movies from their watchlist.
- The watchlist data is saved in the browser's local storage, allowing it to persist across sessions.

## API Integration

- The app integrates with **The Movie Database (TMDb)** to fetch movie data. To use the API, you'll need to sign up on TMDb and generate an API key, which you can add to the `.env` file as shown in the setup instructions.

## Future Improvements

- **Sort and Filter Options**: Add options to sort movies by popularity, rating, release date, etc.
- **Trending TV Shows Section**: Include a section for trending TV shows in addition to movies.
- **Bookmark and Share**: Allow users to bookmark or share their favorite movies.
